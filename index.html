          old and she is a kindergartner at FarmingtonView Elementary School. My
          beautiful wife Sierra and I met almost 10 years ago and have been married
          for almost 9 years. It has been the best years of my life. We like to
          spend time with family&amp;friends and enjoy the outdoors.
